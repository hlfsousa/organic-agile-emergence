# Organic Emergence of Agile Processes

Having witnessed a handful processes of CMMi certifications, most developers realize CMMi certification in general is bollocks. And yet, CMMi certification continues to prosper while agile practices become less and less frequently adopted in the industry. How can this be?

For meta-details, [about](about.html)

This project will be divided in three fronts, which I break down below.

## Knowledge base

In this site, the main project, the rationale for this enterprise will be broken down. This is where the intellectual dialogue about the problems and proposed solutions will happen.

* [Certification is a corporate disease](research/corporate_disease.html)
* [There is a problem with the adoption of Agile](research/abstract.html)
* [Emergence of Agile as Evolutionary Epistemology](research/agile_as_evolutionary_epistemology.html)

## Onthology API

The overarching goal of this project is to create a common language which we can use to make _agile_ the eventual result of an specific approach that has proven effective and has been refined since the Enlightenment. This common language is then going to be translated to a programatic API.

## Tools and services

With an onthology represented by a programatic API, we will be able to create or extend tools and services to foster the proposal put forth herein.
