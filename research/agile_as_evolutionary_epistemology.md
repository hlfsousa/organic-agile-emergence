# Emergence of Agile as Evolutionary Epistemology
Karl Popper describes Evolutionary Epistemology as acquisition of knowledge that improves upon previous ideas by refining them through the elimination of error. He expresses that through the formula:

PS<sub>1</sub> => TT<sub>1</sub> => EE<sub>1</sub> => PS<sub>2</sub>

We start with a problem situation PS<sub>1</sub>; tentative theories TT<sub>1</sub> are systematically subjected to attempts of falsification, and error elimination EE<sub>1</sub> selects the theories that best fit objectives over PS<sub>1</sub>. Their application leads to a different problem situation PS<sub>2</sub>, from which the cycle can start over. However, PS<sub>2</sub> is considered an ideal situation until new difficulties are identified.

In the publication titled [The New Methodology](https://martinfowler.com/articles/newMethodology.html), Manifesto for Agile Software Development signer Martin Fowler gives his account of what led him and his peers to devise and adopt agile practices. Due to the purpose of the text, his account leaves out the error elimination process, but we can identify all other elements in the emergence of agile practices.

In this account we can clearly identify the initial problem spaces, and Martin Fowler also identifies some of the difficulties found after the application of agile values and practices, thus indicating a new cycle of discoveries was or is needed. Due to his purpose in writing the article, he does not give an account of specific practices. But if Evolutionary Epistemology lies in the origin of agile practices, one should find support to this thesis and opposition to the antithesis when Fowler or other Manifesto signers talk about their origin or application. And this can be abundantly found in sources such as:

* [Scrum is simple, just use it as is!!](https://kenschwaber.wordpress.com/2017/11/11/scrum-is-simple-just-use-it-as-is/)
* [InfoQ Interview: Kent Beck on Agile Adoption & Values](https://www.infoq.com/articles/kent-beck-interview-2006)
* [Is TDD dead?](https://martinfowler.com/articles/is-tdd-dead/)
* [Agile is Dead](https://youtu.be/a-BOSpxYJ9M)

Thus we have confirmation that agile practices emerged and are correctly applied as a restatement of Popper’s model: a goal, a practice that achieves it, and verification that the goal was in fact achieved. One common criticism of failed adoption of agile practices is that practitioners lose sight of the goal and fail to achieve it by applying practices with no expected outcome.

>"Oh, you’re sure to do that," said the Cat, "if you only walk long enough."

Clearly, every practice was devised with a goal in mind. One measured either objectively or subjectively, qualitatively or quantitatively, but a goal nonetheless. Which is the same as to say that one needs a valid theory to get from PS<sub>1</sub> to PS<sub>2</sub>.
