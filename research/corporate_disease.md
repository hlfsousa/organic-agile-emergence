# Process certification is a corporate disease

I don't say this lightly. This is not a clickbait or an impact phrase. Also, this is not a rant against CMMi or any other corporate diagnostic process. This is a serious evaluation of how corporations engage with certification. This is as much a criticism of certification as one would criticise a knife used by a murderer.

## Incentive is the key
Why would any company want to get certified? The answer is obvious: to improve its sales pitch. All companies depend on sales, and it is the marketing department that sells a company's products and services. Without sales, there is no profit; without profit there is no company. It is that simple.

Let's make a few inferences. Take any company that relies on some innovation to sell its product. Would it advertise the thing that makes it better than the competition? Do we know the formula for Coca-Cola (Coke if you're in the US)? Do we have the source code for Microsof Office software? Take any number of examples, and you will always find that the thing that makes the product worthy of selling is not public knowledge. But look at certification: everything about CMMi (what are the key process areas and how to comply with each of them for each maturity level) is publicly and widely known and broken down. The same goes for Scrum, XP, PMP, you name it. Certification, both in the individual and corporate sense, is just a piece of paper that people use to improve their sales pitch.

## Corporate certification is a vice
There is a big difference between corporate certification and individual certification. Compare, for instance, Oracle Certified Expert Java EE Web Component Developer (OCEJWCD) and CMMi. An OCEJWCD certificate tells that you could demonstrate that, at one point in time, you know the tools needed to create an assortment of Java web applications and how to use them. That is exactly what employers looking for people to create such applications want, plus other unrelated skills. A CMMi certificate tells potential customers of a company that the company has applied, at least in a handful of audited projects, practices and tools that have the potential of contributing to a successful project. That is not what clients want! And of course, that is not how companies _sell_ their certification.

If I were to hire the services of a company, the most important piece of information is the overall success rate of that company in that type of service. I want to know how effective the product is at the use I am going to give it. If the service I hire is assigned to a team, I want to know the success rate of that team. If the success rate of the company is 95% and all 5% failed projects were executed by a handful of teams, I don't want those. But certification is the opposite of that: it measures the capacity of the company by measuring a small part of it. That small part would be statistically significant if it was a random sample; but the sample is chosen by the company.

Time to make a prediction. This entire enterprise is based on predictions and outcomes. Take a random sample of appraisals (SCAMPI), and I foresee a spectrum with vice and virtue at the extremes. 

On the virtue side, you shall find that:
* Certification is sought out as a way to recognize current practices.
* The certification process does not significantly change how the teams work.
* Management does not need to warn people about what to answer during the audit.
* Audited teams or projects are randomly selected.
* The goal of practices is to profit more by increasing productivity (i.e. reduce cost), and that is a measured indicator. 

On the vice side, you shall find that:
* Certification is sought out as a way of improving sales.
* Productivity/cost indicators and measurements are not expected to improve, nor are they collected.
* Training is offered as preparation for appraisal.
* Most required practices are introduced during preparation for appraisal.
* Required practices are mostly new for the teams.
* Employees (executors) are instructed to "know where to find things", not to know them by heart or by practice.

When certification is a vice, most improvements introduced by the new practicess are lost after a short time.

## Certification business is a vice too
It is easy to see how companies have plenty of incentive to make process/practices/methodology certification a vice. But the same risks apply to companies that grant certification. If a getting certified by one company A is harder than by company B, and the goal of a client is to get certified, they will choose company B. Thus any criticism I make here applies first to companies that seek certification, then to certifiers. As I hinted before, certification is made easier by having appraisal apply to only a few selected projects, and focused on practices rather than objectives and results.

To balance this vice, certifiers also sell training. That allows companies to offer a real service, whether it is attached to certification or not. Even comparing material from, for instance, the CMMi Institute and an appraisal process, shows stark contrast. If anything, this is a hopeful sign that these vices are becoming increasingly evident.
