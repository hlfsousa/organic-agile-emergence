# Dialogue as structured language
In order  to persist a dialogue in a repeatable way, it must not rely on the interpretation of some individual. It must also be structured enough to allow for systematic classification so that two consecutive versions of the dialogue can be compared. Rational Criticism is one attempt to limit the terminology of scientific investigation, and so is the Scientific Method through standardized practices, from peer-review to the structure of scientific papers. 

While a scientific paper deals with a limited scope, however, teams and corporations must take into account all of their goals simultaneously. Reviewing the specification of practices thus takes increasing effort and tends to degrade over time -- just like the cost of manual regression testing eventually becomes too high as software solutions grow.

A robust structure for goal-oriented practices thus becomes key to being able to produce reliable and repeatable dialogues. Based on Rational Criticism and Socratic Dialectics, the authors suggest the following ontology, in natural language:

## Fact
A fact is a phenomenon, actual or desired, that is relevant for some stakeholder. Facts can be initially disconnected and describe some aspect of reality in general terms. These can be simple statements such as “the company has profit”.

## Measurement
Facts are determined by objective measurements. A fact can be determined by any number of facts. Borrowing from the previous example, measurements that support the fact “the company has profit” could be “income is EUR 20M” and “expenses amount to EUR 15M”.

A problem space is demarcated by some desired outcome, so a measurement may also contain a reference value, that is, what is required for the measurement to support the fact rather than refute it. An objective measurement (whether qualitative or quantitative) is preferable over a subjective one, but a subjective measurement is preferable over none at all.

## Practice
A practice is a standardized behavior, whether by regulation or instinct. Something as simple as “one-hour lunch break” may be described as a practice. 

#Influence
A measurement may be influenced by a fact or a practice. Influences can be seen in two ways: as the justification for observable reality -- a description --, or as an attempt to change such observable reality -- a prescriptive, tentative theory.
