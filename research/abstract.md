# There is a problem with the adoption of Agile

Agile methods for software development have been formally proposed since the 1990’s. Though overall results are positive, its adoption seems to be in decline: research by [Serrador and Pinto](https://people.eecs.ku.edu/~hossein/811/Papers/Agility/does-agile-work.pdf) measured full adoption of agile methods at 6% and an overall improvement on project success of 13%. Though measurements differ, the industry expected project success rate to be improved a lot more than that, given the mere 16% informed by the [Chaos Report](https://www.projectsmart.co.uk/white-papers/chaos-report.pdf) in 1995 or even the 29% reported in [2015](https://www.infoq.com/articles/standish-chaos-2015) -- an apparent plateau after a decade of _Agile_. Authors of the _Manifesto for Agile Software Development_, also known as _The Manifesto_, and prominent figures in software development claim that [Agile adoption can be a cargo cult](https://skepticalagile.com/cargo-cult-agile-23340e0647ae), that [Agile is Dead](https://pragdave.me/blog/2014/03/04/time-to-kill-agile.html) and [practitioners are to blame](https://youtu.be/2JNXx8VdbAE). It seems that on one side we have proponents claiming practitioners are not doing it right, and on the other, practitioners not experiencing the wonders promised by companies selling training and tools.

As a [meta study at Elsevier’s Journal of Systems and Software](https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0164121212000532/1-s2.0-S0164121212000532-main.pdf?_tid=78f1361e-bcd4-4b9e-90c1-7b3d69c22cb9&acdnat=1535195969_38b35821b375469c47c6eef55baf071b) demonstrates, publications on Agile abound, but there is little research on the theoretical basis of agile practices. How would software development change if, instead of applying practices blindly, teams could use a method that caused effective practices to emerge and be correctly applied -- a self-correcting method for agile practices? The natural sciences do have such a method for investigating the natural world -- the scientific method -- but there is no such unifying method for software development.

In the only paper on the theory of agile mentioned by Elsevier’s meta study, [Karl Popper’s Critical Rationalism in Agile Software Development](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11787181_26), Northover et al take a step in that direction. By building upon Critical Rationalism and the epistemology behind it we try to demonstrate that the lack of a method that bridges the values put forth in _The Manifesto_ to the practices applied by each practitioner and the results thereof is at the heart of the aforementioned criticism. Just as science relies on the scientific method and cannot be practiced without it, effective practices must rely on a valid method. In doing that, we also delineate this method and how it can be used in a repeatable manner.
